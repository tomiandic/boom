    review: "I was on this party boat on 08/15/2021 and it was breathtaking, great music, nice people and a lot of alcohol, etc. On this party boat, partying and a good mood are capitalized. Everyone who is in the vicinity of Pula has to go there once or even several times. I will definitely be back next year. Keep it up to the organizers, simply a 5 out of 5 stars.",
